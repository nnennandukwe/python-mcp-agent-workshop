  "keyword_count": 2319,
  "file_summary": "This file contains a large dictionary named PYTHON_VERSIONS that maps Python versions to download URLs and checksums for various platform-specific CPython builds. It is a generated file, likely used by the `pbs_installer` package to fetch and install different Python versions.",
  "significance_explanation": "The high occurrence of the keyword 'python' is expected as the file's main purpose is to manage data about Python distributions. The keyword appears in the URLs pointing to `python-build-standalone` releases and in the `PythonVersion` class instances. This file is central to the functionality of the `pbs_installer` tool, which is designed to install Python builds, hence the frequent use of the word 'python'. This is not an indication of a code organization problem but rather a reflection of the file's data-centric nature."
