## Agent Configuration and Tool Access

### Tool Access Declaration
Agent configurations must explicitly declare which MCP tools they intend to use, enabling security controls and performance optimization.

**Access Control Patterns:**
- **Explicit Tool Listing**: Agents declare specific tools they need access to
- **Server-Based Access**: Agents request access to entire MCP servers
- **Permission Boundaries**: Security controls limiting agent tool usage
- **Resource Quotas**: Limits on tool usage frequency or resource consumption
- **Audit Logging**: Tracking of tool usage for security and optimization

### Agent Instruction Integration
The agent's natural language instructions must effectively incorporate MCP tool usage into their reasoning and workflow patterns.

**Instruction Integration Strategies:**
- **Tool-Aware Reasoning**: Instructions that understand tool capabilities and limitations
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Step-by-step processes that incorporate tool usage
- **Error Handling**: Instructions for graceful handling of tool failures
- **Result Interpretation**: Guidance on understanding and acting on tool outputs
- **Quality Assessment**: Criteria for evaluating tool results and overall analysis quality

### Parameter Mapping and Context Passing
Agents must translate user inputs and contextual information into appropriate tool parameters while maintaining type safety and validation.

**Parameter Construction Patterns:**
- **User Input Mapping**: Converting user commands into tool-specific parameters
- **Context Enrichment**: Adding relevant environmental information to tool calls
- **Type Conversion**: Ensuring parameter types match tool schema requirements
- **Validation Logic**: Pre-call validation to prevent predictable failures
